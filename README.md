# Map Project

I took the opportunity with the Map Project to highlight the most popular Asian restaurants near where I live, according to Foursquare checkins.

### Features of the app

The Map Project meets all of the Udacity project requirements by providing the following features:
* A selectable list of 5 suburbs in Chicago's North Shore
* The listing of the 5 most popular Asian restaurants in the selected suburb
* The ability to hide / show any of the restaurants on the map
* Animated map markers when a suburb is selected, a restaurant list item is selected, or the marker itself is clicked
* An info window displaying the name of the restaurant and the number of Foursquare checkins

### Installation

Map Project requires [source code](https://github.com/alexagran/MapProject) to be installed within one folder. The source code can be installed in any local directory. 

To test the site
1. Make sure you have an internet connection as frameworks suchs as Knockout and Bootstrap are leveraged using CDNs
2. Navigate to the local directory where you downloaded the source code
3. Launch index.html
